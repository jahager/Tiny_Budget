# Tiny Budget
#### Make budgeting easy!
## Project Goal
Tiny budget aims to be a **simplified** envelope budgeting app.

## Solved Problem
The concept comes from disdain of logging into another random passworded service for the simple act of recording income and payments. New budgeting apps require monthly payments and store your data in the cloud. In this project, all these _services_ are considered negative **bloat**.

## Allowed Features
1. Adding Budget
2. Adding Payments
3. Deleting Budgets/Payments
4. High level view of amount left in each budget
